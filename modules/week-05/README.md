# Week 5: Classification Techniques

### Overview
Learn classification algorithms and apply them to a real dataset.

### Objectives
- Understand logistic regression and decision trees
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Perform train/test splits and cross-validation

### Tasks
1. Train a logistic regression model on Titanic dataset.
2. Build a decision tree classifier on another dataset.
3. Compare metrics and discuss trade-offs.
4. Put it all into a streamlit app and take screenshots of the streamlit app for your README.md.
5. Add in some visuals from matplotlib about the Ttiantic data into your streamlit app on a seperate page.
