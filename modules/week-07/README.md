# Week 7: Feature Engineering & Ensemble Learning

### Overview
Create new features and combine models for better performance.

### Objectives
- Generate interaction and aggregated features
- Use Random Forests and Gradient Boosting
- Evaluate ensemble performance vs. single models

### Tasks
1. Engineer at least 3 new features on a dataset.
2. Train a Random Forest and an XGBoost model.
3. Compare results and analyze feature importances.
