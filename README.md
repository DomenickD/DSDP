# Data Science Development Program

Welcome to the Data Science Development Program! Below you'll find a week-by-week breakdown of topics we'll cover during this 13-week course. Each week's title links to additional resources and detailed content.

## Tips to Get the Most Out of This Program:
* _Actively participate in weekly projects_
* _Consistently push your code to GitHub_
* _Practice applying new techniques to previous projects_
* _Explore additional resources independently to enhance your understanding and accelerate your learning_

Building your GitHub portfolio is essential in this course. Upload your code regularlyâ€”ideally daily, but at least weekly.
